To maintain their upscale suburban lifestyles, these goal oriented couples work, often commuting far and working long hours. However, their schedules are fine-tuned to meet the needs of their school age children...\",\"This is the new growth market, with a profile similar to the original young professionals with families that have opted to trade up to the newest housing in the suburbs. The original Boomburbs neighborhoods began growing in the 1990s and continued through the peak of the housing boom... \",\"Savvy Suburbanites residents are well educated, well read, and well capitalized. Families include empty nesters and empty nester wannabes, who still have adult children at home. Located in older neighborhoods outside the urban core, their suburban lifestyle includes home remodeling and gardening plus the active pursuit of sports and exercise... \",\"Exurbanites residents are now approaching retirement but showing few signs of slowing down. They are active in their communities, generous in their donations, and seasoned travelers. They take advantage of their proximity to large metropolitan centers to support the arts but prefer a more expansive home style in less crowded neighborhoods... \",\"Urban Chic residents are professionals that live a sophisticated, exclusive lifestyle. Half of all households are occupied by married-couple families and about 30 percent are singles. These are busy, well-connected, and well-educated consumers-avid readers and movie goers, environmentally active, and financially stable... \",\"Prosperous domesticity best describes the settled denizens of Pleasantville. Situated principally in older housing in suburban areas in the Northeast (especially in New York and New Jersey) and secondarily in the West (especially in California), these slightly older couples move less than any other market. Many couples have already transitioned to empty nesters. Many are still home to adult children... \",\"Pacific Heights is one of the smaller markets (with less than 1 percent of households), composed of upscale neighborhoods in the urban periphery of metropolitan areas, along the Pacific Coast in California, in Hawaii, and in the Northeast. This market includes the highest percentage of multiracial populations. This is a family market, distinguished by married-couple families, with and without children, some in multigenerational households... \",\"Enterprising Professionals residents are well educated and climbing the ladder in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) occupations. They change jobs often and therefore choose to live in condos, town homes, or apartments - many still rent their homes... \",\"Laptops and Lattes residents are predominantly single, well-educated professionals in business, finance, legal, computer, and entertainment occupations. They are affluent and partial to city living-and its amenities. Neighborhoods are densely populated, primarily located in the cities of large metropolitan areas. Many residents walk, bike, or use public transportation to get to work... \",\"Residents in this highly mobile and educated market live alone or with a roommate in older apartment buildings and condos located in the urban core of the city.

The popularity of urban life continues to increase for consumers in their late twenties and thirties...\",\"Armed with the motto -you are only young once-, Trendsetters residents live life to its full potential. These educated young singles are not ready to settle down. They do not own homes or vehicles and choose to spend their disposable income on upscale city living and entertainment... \",\"Workday Drive is an affluent, family-oriented market with a country flavor. Residents are partial to new housing away from the bustle of the city but close enough to commute to professional job centers. Life in this suburban wilderness offsets the hectic pace of two working parents with growing children... \",\"Married-couple families occupy well over half of these suburban households. Most Home Improvement residences are single-family homes that are owner occupied, with only one-fifth of the households occupied by renters. Education and diversity levels are similar to the US as a whole... \",\"Middleburg neighborhoods transformed from the easy pace of country living to semirural subdivisions in the last decade, when the housing boom reached out. Residents are traditional, family-oriented consumers. Still more country than rock and roll they are thrifty but willing to carry some debt and are already investing in their futures... \",\"Residents in this large, growing segment are older, with more than half of all householders aged 55 or older. Many still live in the suburbs where they grew up. Comfortable Empty Nesters are mostly professionals working in government, health care, or manufacturing. These Baby Boomers are earning a comfortable living and benefitting from years of prudent investing and saving... \",\"In Style denizens embrace an urbane lifestyle that includes support of the arts, travel, and extensive reading. They are connected and make full use of the advantages of mobile devices. Professional couples or single households without children, they have the time to focus on their homes and their interests. The population is slightly older and already planning for their retirement. \",\"These suburbanites have achieved the dream of home ownership.

Many of these families are two-income married ccouples approaching retirement age... \",\"The backbone of older industrial cities in states surrounding the Great Lakes, Rustbelt Traditions residents are a mix of married-couple families and singles living in older developments of single-family homes. While varied, the work force is primarily white collar, with a higher concentration of skilled workers in manufacturing, retail trade, and health care... \",\"Midlife Constants residents are seniors, at or approaching retirement, with below average labor force participation and above average net worth.

Aside from the obvious expense for the upkeep for upkeep of their lavish homes, consumers select upscale salons, spas, and fitness centers for their personal well-being and shop at high-end retailers for their personal effects...\",\"Professional Pride consumers are well-educated career professionals that have prospered through the Great Recession. To maintain their upscale suburban lifestyles, these goal oriented couples work, often commuting far and working long hours. However, their schedules are fine-tuned to meet the needs of their school age children...\",\"This is the new growth market, with a profile similar to the original young professionals with families that have opted to trade up to the newest housing in the suburbs. The original Boomburbs neighborhoods began growing in the 1990s and continued through the peak of the housing boom... \",\"Savvy Suburbanites residents are well educated, well read, and well capitalized. Families include empty nesters and empty nester wannabes, who still have adult children at home. Located in older neighborhoods outside the urban core, their suburban lifestyle includes home remodeling and gardening plus the active pursuit of sports and exercise... \",\"Exurbanites residents are now approaching retirement but showing few signs of slowing down. They are active in their communities, generous in their donations, and seasoned travelers. They take advantage of their proximity to large metropolitan centers to support the arts but prefer a more expansive home style in less crowded neighborhoods... \",\"Urban Chic residents are professionals that live a sophisticated, exclusive lifestyle. Half of all households are occupied by married-couple families and about 30 percent are singles. These are busy, well-connected, and well-educated consumers-avid readers and movie goers, environmentally active, and financially stable... \",\"Prosperous domesticity best describes the settled denizens of Pleasantville. Situated principally in older housing in suburban areas in the Northeast (especially in New York and New Jersey) and secondarily in the West (especially in California), these slightly older couples move less than any other market. Many couples have already transitioned to empty nesters. Many are still home to adult children... \",\"Pacific Heights is one of the smaller markets (with less than 1 percent of households), composed of upscale neighborhoods in the urban periphery of metropolitan areas, along the Pacific Coast in California, in Hawaii, and in the Northeast.

This is a family market, distinguished by married-couple families, with and without children, some in multigenerational households... \",\"Enterprising Professionals residents are well educated and climbing the ladder in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) occupations.

They are affluent and partial to city living-and its amenities. Neighborhoods are densely populated, primarily located in the cities of large metropolitan areas. Many residents walk, bike, or use public transportation to get to work... \",\"Residents in this highly mobile and educated market live alone or with a roommate in older apartment buildings and condos located in the urban core of the city. Metro Renters is one of the fastest growing segments. The popularity of urban life continues to increase for consumers in their late twenties and thirties...\",\"Armed with the motto -you are only young once-, Trendsetters residents live life to its full potential. These educated young singles are not ready to settle down. They do not own homes or vehicles and choose to spend their disposable income on upscale city living and entertainment... \",\"Workday Drive is an affluent, family-oriented market with a country flavor. Residents are partial to new housing away from the bustle of the city but close enough to commute to professional job centers. Life in this suburban wilderness offsets the hectic pace of two working parents with growing children... \",\"Married-couple families occupy well over half of these suburban households. Most Home Improvement residences are single-family homes that are owner occupied, with only one-fifth of the households occupied by renters. Education and diversity levels are similar to the US as a whole... \",\"Middleburg neighborhoods transformed from the easy pace of country living to semirural subdivisions in the last decade, when the housing boom reached out. Residents are traditional, family-oriented consumers. Still more country than rock and roll they are thrifty but willing to carry some debt and are already investing in their futures... \",\"Residents in this large, growing segment are older, with more than half of all householders aged 55 or older. Many still live in the suburbs where they grew up. Comfortable Empty Nesters are mostly professionals working in government, health care, or manufacturing. These Baby Boomers are earning a comfortable living and benefitting from years of prudent investing and saving... \",\"In Style denizens embrace an urbane lifestyle that includes support of the arts, travel, and extensive reading. They are connected and make full use of the advantages of mobile devices. Professional couples or single households without children, they have the time to focus on their homes and their interests. The population is slightly older and already planning for their retirement. \",\"These suburbanites have achieved the dream of home ownership.

Many of these families are two-income married ccouples approaching retirement age... \",\"The backbone of older industrial cities in states surrounding the Great Lakes, Rustbelt Traditions residents are a mix of married-couple families and singles living in older developments of single-family homes. While varied, the work force is primarily white collar, with a higher concentration of skilled workers in manufacturing, retail trade, and health care... \",\"Midlife Constants residents are seniors, at or approaching retirement, with below average labor force participation and above average net worth. Although located in predominantly metropolitan areas, they live outside the central cities, in smaller communities. Their lifestyle is more country than urban. They are generous, but not spendthrifts. \",\"The Green Acres lifestyle features country living and self-reliance. Avid do-it-yourselfers, they maintain and remodel their homes with all the necessary power tools to accomplish the jobs. Gardening, especially growing vegetables, is a priority, with the right tools, tillers, tractors, and riding mowers... \",\"Salt of the Earth residents are entrenched in their traditional, rural lifestyles.
